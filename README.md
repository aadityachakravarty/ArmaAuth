ArmaAuth
======

This is a simple armathentication script for the 3D lightcycle game Armagetron Advanced (http://armagetronad.org/).  The script is designed to fit in with a forum authentication table with minimal modification to the forum software.  All that is required is that there is a MySQL backend that stores a password in MD5 format with a static salt, if any.  To use the script, put it and its configuration file in the folder /armaauth/0.1/ under the root of the website and configure it for your authentication table.
